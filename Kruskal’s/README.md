# Krustal Algorithm
- In Krustal's algorithm, the set A is a forest whose vertices are all those of the given graph. The safe edge added to A is always the lowest-weight edge in the graph that connects two distick components. 

- It assumes that the input is connected and represented by adjancy lists. c
